# Symmetry

## Art piece created by Jackie Luc

___

*Symmetry* is a visual art project that I created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript - primarily using the Javascript library [p5.js](http://p5js.org/). My goal with this project was to explore a new technology that can assist in creating a visually appealing art piece that could be showcased on the web. I was largely inspired by how nature creates such beautiful symmetric structures and thought that Mathematics would also create unique and interesting structures.
